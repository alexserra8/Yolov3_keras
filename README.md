# Yolov3_keras

In this respository there are two Jupyter Notebooks which define the YoloV3 network in Keras.

· "Definicion del modelo" --> is the main *.ipynb where the YoloV3 is fully defined. Perfect for training the model.

· "Funciones Yolo" --> a reduced *.ipynb where there are only the functions you will need to run to start your model once you have it trained.
