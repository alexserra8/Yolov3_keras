# Yolov3_keras

In this respository there are two Jupyter Notebooks which define the YoloV3 network in Keras. This is repository can be used to train or test the YoloV3.

    - "Definicion del modelo" --> is the main *.ipynb where the YoloV3 is fully defined. Perfect for training the model.

    - "Funciones Yolo" --> a reduced *.ipynb where there are only the functions you will need to run to start your model once you have it trained.


Furthermore, there is a folder called "BeforeTrain" where you can find two Jupyter Notebooks which can helps to create more data (Data augmentation) and helps you to split data between training and validation:

    · "Distorsionar Fotos" --> We apply data augmentation using GAUSSIAN NOISE. Also, a code is written to obtain also the new bounding boxes we are obtaining in format *.txt that Yolo require.

    · "ExtractText_Train_Valid" --> In this notebook, once we have all the images, we split them in training and validation data. We obtain two files in format *.txt, one where there are the locations of training images, and the other with the locations of the validation images. This is the format required for Yolo.
