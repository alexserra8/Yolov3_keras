# Yolov3_keras

In this respository there are two Jupyter Notebooks which define the YoloV3 network in Keras. This is repository can be used to train or test the YoloV3.

    · "Definicion del modelo" --> is the main *.ipynb where the YoloV3 is fully defined. Perfect for training the model.

    · "Funciones Yolo" --> a reduced *.ipynb where there are only the functions you will need to run to start your model once you have it trained.
